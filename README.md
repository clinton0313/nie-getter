# nie-getter
A script to automatically fill out info to try to get a nie appointment in Spain

The script is currently hard-coded just for getting the "TOMA DE HUELLAS" which is the one you need to do if you are a visiting international student and need to extend your initial NIE visa. The script can obviously be improved to allow for generally all cases, etc. 

Notes: The appointments seem to come out at around 8:30am BCN time and new ones continuously pop up until 10:30am. This is just my observation. Also, make sure you leave the expiry date field blank. I had mine filled out to my passport expiry and I never got an appointment for weeks, and then as soon as I left it blank I got one the next day. Good luck. 

Last note: you need to install Selenium and Geckodriver and it runs via Firefox.
